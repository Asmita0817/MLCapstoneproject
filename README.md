# ðŸ“Š Salary Prediction using Machine Learning (Capstone Project)

This project is a complete machine learning pipeline that predicts the **Expected Salary (CTC)** of a candidate based on features like experience, education, department, and more.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- CSV file containing candidate profiles and expected salaries
- Features include:
  - Total Experience
  - Department, Role, Industry
  - Current CTC
  - Education, Certifications, Publications
  - Designation, Appraisal, Graduation/PG details

---

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (RandomForestRegressor)
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

---

## ðŸ§¼ Data Preprocessing
- Dropped high-NaN PhD columns
- Filled missing text with `"Unknown"`
- Filled missing years with `median`
- Label Encoding for categorical features

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Model & Metrics
